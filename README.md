Radioactivity monitoring offers the opportunity to understand its impact on ocean ecosystems in various extreme locations, such as underwater volcanoes, seismic faults or deep-ocean drilling locations. To expand radioactivity monitoring capabilities one possibility is to use radiation spectrometers integrated aboard autonomous underwater vehicles, namely underwater gliders, to perform in situ natural and artificial radioactivity measurements in the marine environment. The problem of detecting sources of radioactivity with one or more underwater gliders equipped with radiation spectrometers is a challenging one given the large search areas and the small detection distance of the sensors. To address this problem, in this paper trajectory generation algorithms are devised to compute a trajectory that maximises the probability of detecting a specific source, in particular through the solution of a generalized optimal control problem with an exponential detection model. One of the main challenges is that the optimization problem may be complex for standard solvers given that the problem is in general non-convex. Therefore, we study and adapt trajectory planning algorithms that are more suitable for this objective function.
